# sniffer

This is CUI application and operation guarantee is only Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS

This is sniffer using libpcap (ethernet header, ipv4 header , tcp header and udp header)

So, you must install `libpcap` to use this

There is no dependency on each c file, so compile and run on each

Unfortunately, this sniffer hasn't corresponded to IPv6 yet
